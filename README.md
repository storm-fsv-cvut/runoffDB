This is a database structure created to store data and metadata related to rainfall-runoff experiments and measurements in general. Primary focus is data collected during rainfall simulator experiments but expanding the structure for other kind of collected hydrological research data is one of the future goals.
# platform
The tables and relations structure is written in MySQL
# installation
To install the database just use the source code as a query in your MySQL server
